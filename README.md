# Quizlet-Bypass
Hi! This extension requires Firefox, because Google doesn't like extensions that bypass paywalls

## Legal Disclaimer
This extension is for educational purposes only, we do not condone piracy.

## For nerds:
If you're interested, here's how it works.

- We redirect clicks on the "Flashcards", "Learn", "Test" and "Match" buttons to their embed links.
  - Embeds can be used without signing in - as long as we block the sign-in popup.

The reason this extension isn't a Chrome extension is because Google Chrome and other Chromium based browsers make it quite difficult to install extensions from outside of the Chrome Extension Store. The Chrome Extension Store is reviewed by people who work at Google and understandably they would not approve an extension that could, in theory, be legally questionable. Mozilla has a more open approach to extensions and only restricts malicious content.
